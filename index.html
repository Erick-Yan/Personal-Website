                                <p>Hi, Erick here, and on my left is 14 year old me. Fresh off of quitting piano lessons, I was
                                entering my first year in high school, living out my youth to its fullest with no concern for the future at all. 5 years later,
                        I ended up as a Chemical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with hobbies and interests
                that extend past my program. My drive to expand my experiences and develop new skills has never been more profound than now, as I
                continue to search for my true career aspiration. I hope this website will help you get to know me a little better as a person.</p>

                                <p>Although I received Honours for the RCM Advanced Rudiments Theory Exam,
                                        Grade 8 Piano Exam and various Piano Competitions, playing piano has always felt empty. After quitting
                                        in 2014, I shortly regained my passion after watching a few YouTube videos. Artists such as
                                        Ludovico Einaudi, Giovanni Allevi and Yiruma introduced entirely new genres of music to me. In recent years,
                                        I have discovered new meaning within the classical pieces I onced loathed through Chopin and Schubert.
                                        Having quit for 5 years, I have continued my piano education and training on my own, hoping to
                                        return one day to finish where I left off.</p>

                                <p>After going through the "I'm going to make the NBA" phase in 8th grade, I fell in love with the sport
                                        in a different manner. While training improved my technical skillsets, I was also focused on building leadership
                                        and an assertive mindset. I was especially inspired by Oklahoma City Thunder's Point Guard, Chris Paul,
                                        who has molded the way I approach the game, how I help my teammates, and much more.
                                        Playing 4 years of rep basketball provincially provided me invaluable
                                        experience as a team captain and playmaker, helping my team as a whole improve and make it to
                                        the next level.</p>

                                <p>It's surprising how much a camera can expand your travelling experiences. While I may not be
                                        the most proficient photographer, I treat it more as a hobby. Whenever we go on vacations to places
                                         like Switzerland, or even biking locally at Toronto's Lakeshore, my camera has been able to capture vivid
                                        memories that my family, friends and I will cherish for years to come.</p>

                                <p>This past summer, my programming journey was jumpstarted at the Hack the 6ix competition.
                                        My team and I built Citizen A, a web application that allows
                                        car accident witnesses to submit a witness statement report upon a collision. We were inspired by the slow and obscure process
                                        for submitting these statements, and wanted to create a more accessible method for witnesses through our smooth and intuitive UI.
                                        Our project was recognized by companies such as
                                        Microsoft and Intact Insurance as a viable product towards insurance-related predicaments.</p>

                                <p>As my very first C++ project, I created my first game on
                                        Visual Studios Code. The game generates one number that represents the sum and one
                                        number that represents the product of a specific number of unknown numbers. The challenge is for the user to
                                        guess what the numbers are that will create the generated product and sum values. I was able to effectively learn and utilize various
                                        functions and object-oriented programming principles to create a challenging game that increases in difficulty as the user completes each problem.</p>

                                <p>My passion towards basketball and the NBA was extended through data analytics once I discovered Python Pandas. By using NBA statistic
                                        databases to collect player data, I created a correlational analysis on how one player affects another in terms of points, assists, efficiency
                                        and more. This allowed me to make precise conclusions on a player's true value to their teammates, which reflects
                                         the recruitment processes within the NBA.</p>

                                <p>After receiving a Udemy Certification for completing the MOS Excel Expert Course, I decided to create
                                        my own online training module to help prepare myself for the MOS Excel Expert Exam. Most of the application
                                        was built on JavaScript classes and embedded Excel Sheets.
                                        The process of creating the practice problems helped accelerate my ability to grasp and better
                                        understand advanced Excel concepts, especially in real-world settings. The module provides random

                                        and Tourism contestant in the DECA competition. While barely passing the threshold score to enter Provincials,
                                        I was able to come back stronger and take the Top Ten award to qualify for the International DECA Competition. Although holding
                                        that award on stage was unreal, the resilience, experience in negotitiation and critical thinking I amassed during the long hours of practice with my partner

                                <p>Although my expectations going into the job wasn't high as a first year coop student, the Region of Peel ended up facilitating one of the
                                        most well-rounded engineering experiences I've ever had. As a PM intern, I jumped into numerous ongoing building
                                        renovation, equipment assessment, policy implementation projects. During these projects, I was often immersed in AutoCAD
                                        P&ID drawing analysis and measurements. Building condition assessments provided me with a broader understanding
                                        of various types of equipments such as exhaust fans or conduit line systems and how to test their functionality. Large amounts of collected
                                        data from these assessments allowed me to utilize advanced Excel functions and Pivot Tables to help summarize the information. I was also fortunate to
                                        have been able to initiate a window AC policy change project for all Peel residential buildings, exposing me to types of AC systems, contract/policy writing, and government
                                        procedures on projects like these. In the end, the team atmosphere I was surrounded with during meetings and lunches allowed me to create lasting bonds I hope to reignite one day.

                                        there is always more to learn. Although I was engaged in a month-long business project
                                        to sell a flood protection device, a task to build eco-friendly robots, and plenty of early morning lectures on topics ranging from
                                        pharmacogenomics to marathon preparation, the connections I made along the way proved to be the most valuable. The conversations
                                        we had on our way to the top of Mount Girabaldi, the piano playing sessions during the evening, the stories we shared with one another
                                        made this the most unexpected eye-opening experiences I've ever had in my life.</p>
